        <h2>Happy fucking birthday Topher Daus</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            My handwriting is much uglier than yours so I typed this letter, but that shouldn't make the content any less real or invalid. You are one of the most unique, out of pocket, reckless, hysterical, creative, and inspiring people I've ever met. Everyday, in one way or another, you remind me of how grateful I am to have you in my life and how different my life would be if we had never become friends in freshman year. I honestly can't even imagine how different both our lives would be if we hadn't met each other. 
        </p>

            Our friendship is fascinating to me because it is so raw and I feel like it stands on a couple basic values that we share in common: Ambition, Spontaneity, and Quality. We both individually exhibit these 3 values, and they are even more pronounced when we are together.
        </p>
        <h3>Ambition</h3>

        <h3>Quality</h3>
        <p>
            When I think Chris Daus, I think quality. You hold yourself to your own standard and it's a pretty god damn high standard. Everything you do oozes quality, from your relationships, to your work with Nice As Heck, to your films, to your thrift shopping adventures. Everything is maximized to the be the most high quality that it can be. We've had many conversations about how much I value quality and how I believe it is directly correlated with polymathy and being an effective leader. You are on track to change the world and the lives of so many people and I can't wait to be by your side when you do.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Long story short - In no way are you perfect, but you are a fucking inspiration and role model to me in so many ways and I am so grateful to have you in my life till the day I die.</p>
        <p>Love you so much dude,</p>
        <p>-Glabe Henderson</p>
