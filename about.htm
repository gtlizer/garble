                <p>Hi! I’m Gabe Tiger Lizer. A junior web developer, photoshop fanatic, and rock climbing fiend who wants to travel the world almost as much I want to change it.</p>
                <p>My journey began in Los Angeles, California. Born and raised in the San Fernando Valley. I was a child of many interests. I loved building things just so I could destroy them and build them all over again. I tried every sport there was and played on every type of team you could imagine only to discover that club sports weren’t for me. More importantly though I spent countless hours in nature; camping, hiking, rock climbing, and exploring the outdoors as a kid. I spent my summers at YMCA summer camps and my winters on road trips around the country. I was a nomadic child both physically and mentally and learned to be open to new ideas, experiences, and emotions from a young age. </p>
                <p>Having strong connections to the YMCA from a young age led to me to join and become a leader in their Model Legislature and Court Program called Youth & Government (Y&G). It was here that I learned the value of leadership and found a community that I could invest my time and energy into. I found my voice at Y&G and grew from a spirited freshman sitting in the back of the room to the president standing in front of 200 peers and giving speeches on a weekly basis about life lessons from my 94 year old South African grandfather. </p>
                <p>While my deep connection with nature and politics deepened another interest of mine found a home as well. I had always loved animals from a young age. I was the kid that would stop to pet your dog on the street no matter the time or the place; and I wouldn’t stop petting it until it wanted to go home with me instead of you. This passion for animals led me to attend the North Hollywood High School Zoo Magnet for high school. My high school gave me the opportunity to work with the okapi, kudu, ostrich, and red river hogs at the LA Zoo on a daily basis. </p>
                <p>Working at the zoo led to my later participation on an expedition to the Tsavo Reservation in the heart of Southern Kenya in the summer before I attended college. The expedition was tasked with investigating and resolving the growing struggle between rural Kenyan farmers and wild African elephants through scientific means and peaceful methods. The expedition lasted two weeks and has been one of the most formative experiences thus far in my life, and I am eager to explain the further intricacies of the project to anyone in person.</p>
                <p>Upon entering college, I had no idea if I should pursue my interest in politics or my interest in animal sciences. So I settled on web development and computer science instead. Since I decided to throw myself full force into the world of the Internet, IoT, Web Design, and Software Development I have never looked back. And have been eager to get more involved with the field in every way that I can. I am in pursuit of catching up with a field of study that continues to change every day and therefore will always have a more knowledge for me to learn. </p>
                <p>I have learned the value in taking full advantage of every opportunity that presents itself to me in life in hopes of evolving my talents, abilities, and mindset. Applying this lesson is one of my life goals and attending Syracuse University and seizing all of the opportunities it has to offer is just the latest step in pursuit of that life goal. Who knows what the next step is. Certainly not me…</p>
